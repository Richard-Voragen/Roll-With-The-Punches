# Presskit
### Description
A loser, bottom-of-the-barrel boxer going on a run finds a pair of golden boxing gloves. After putting on the boxing gloves, the washed up boxer realizes that the gloves are magic, giving him incredible new powers such as shooting fireballs from throwing a punch. With his newfound power, the boxer decides to get revenge on the underground boxing ring that ruined his boxing career. 

Roll With The Punches is a 2D run-and-gun platformer where the player will have to overcome stage obstacles and takedown a variety of grunts left and right with their new powers to reach the boss. The gameplay will consist of a platform style game where the player will be able to move left and right, as well as jump on top of any obstacles in their way.
