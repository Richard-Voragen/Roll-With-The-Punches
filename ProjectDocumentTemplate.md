# The title of your game #

## Summary ##

**A paragraph-length pitch for your game.**

**Roll With The Punches** is a platforming run and gun starring our main character, a boxer named **Arthur**. After a less-than-successful start to his career, he was humiliated in a match against the **Champ**. After suffering a huge blow to his pride, he came upon golden gloves that promised him the power to defeat anyone... at a cost that he could never lose again. With desperation, he agrees and thus inherits the elemental powers of electricity, fire, and ice, which is a fundamental aspect of the gameplay, throughout the venture **Arthur** will be up against a multitude of **The Champ's** lackeys, which is where type matchups will come into play. He aims to traverse through the underground fight club owned by **The Champ** and take him down to reclaim his pride and fulfill his contract with the golden gloves. The stages will include a multitude of projectiles, obstacles, and platforming, but with the help of the golden gloves, **Arthur** just might have a shot.

## Gameplay Explanation ##

**In this section, explain how the game should be played. Treat this as a manual within a game. Explaining the button mappings and the most optimal gameplay strategy is encouraged.**


**Add it here if you did work that should be factored into your grade but does not fit easily into the proscribed roles! Please include links to resources and descriptions of game-related material that does not fit into roles here.**

# Main Roles #

Producer: Richard Voragen

Your goal is to relate the work of your role and sub-role in terms of the content of the course. Please look at the role sections below for specific instructions for each role.

Below is a template for you to highlight items of your work. These provide the evidence needed for your work to be evaluated. Try to have at least four such descriptions. They will be assessed on the quality of the underlying system and how they are linked to course content. 

*Short Description* - Long description of your work item that includes how it is relevant to topics discussed in class. [link to evidence in your repository](https://github.com/dr-jam/ECS189L/edit/project-description/ProjectDocumentTemplate.md)

Here is an example:  
*Procedural Terrain* - The game's background consists of procedurally generated terrain produced with Perlin noise. The game can modify this terrain at run-time via a call to its script methods. The intent is to allow the player to modify the terrain. This system is based on the component design pattern and the procedural content generation portions of the course. [The PCG terrain generation script](https://github.com/dr-jam/CameraControlExercise/blob/513b927e87fc686fe627bf7d4ff6ff841cf34e9f/Obscura/Assets/Scripts/TerrainGenerator.cs#L6).

You should replay any **bold text** with your relevant information. Liberally use the template when necessary and appropriate.

## Producer (Richard Voragen)

As producer I was tasked with ensuring that my group was up to date on the plan with the game and caught up with deadlines. In order to do this I created a detailed Gantt spreadsheet detailing all of tasks each group member was tasked to do and when those tasks had to be submitted. <br> Beyond that I organized weekly meetings on those deadline days where each group member would show off what they have completed. Every Tuesday I would check in with each group member every Tuesday to remind them what is due that Thurday and I would message each group member on Thursdays to assign them their work for the week.<br>
Along with organizing those meetings and updates I also helped a lot with the coding when group members fell behind schedule due to school or other personal reasons since it was my job to keep the group on schedule.

## User Interface and Input

**Describe your user interface and how it relates to gameplay. This can be done via the template.**
**Describe the default input configuration.**

**Add an entry for each platform or input style your project supports.**

## Movement/Physics

**Describe the basics of movement and physics in your game. Is it the standard physics model? What did you change or modify? Did you make your movement scripts that do not use the physics system?**

## Animation and Visuals

**List your assets, including their sources and licenses.**

**Describe how your work intersects with game feel, graphic design, and world-building. Include your visual style guide if one exists.**

## Game Logic

**Document the game states and game data you managed and the design patterns you used to complete your task.**
